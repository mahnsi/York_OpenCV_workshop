# York OpenCV Workshop

Welcome to the **York University OpenCV Workshop** repository! This project is dedicated to the workshop on OpenCV, hosted at York University, where we introduced OpenCV concepts and demonstrated practical applications. In this workshop, we also connected OpenCV with Pygame to create a game, showcasing how OpenCV can be used in interactive applications.

## Workshop Overview

The workshop covers the basics of OpenCV, a powerful open-source computer vision library, and demonstrates how to implement various computer vision tasks. Attendees gained hands-on experience with OpenCV in tasks such as image processing, feature detection, object tracking, and hand detection using Google's Mediapipe. The workshop also showcased how OpenCV can be connected with Pygame to create interactive applications, allowing participants to explore computer vision techniques in fun and engaging ways.


### Key Topics:
- **Create Virtual Environment**: Setting up a virtual environment for OpenCV projects.
- **Images and Webcam**: Working with images and webcam input using OpenCV.
- **Noise Removal**: Techniques for reducing noise in images for cleaner data.
- **Simple Object Detection**: Basic methods for detecting objects in images.
- **Color Detection**: Demonstrating how to detect specific colors in images.
- **Hand Detection**: Using OpenCV and mediaPipe to detect and track hands in real-time.
- **Finger Frenzy**: A demo game built using OpenCV to test finger speed and accuracy.
- **Gesture Pong**: A demo game where Pong is controlled by hand gestures.
